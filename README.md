Input

 The "MyResume" online software takes in fixed input data, which includes the user's personal information, educational history, skills, work experience, and project details.  The Resume.js file contains this information as a React component.  The application uses a specific CSS file, Resume.js, to style the page according to the rules, such as colors, margins, and fonts.

 Process

 The app is made with React.   The App.js code shows the Resume component when the application starts.   The Resume.js part breaks the supplied data into groups, such as Education, Skills, Experience, and Projects.   The Resume.css file uses styles to make the colors, layout, and fonts look like the design that was given.   React's virtual DOM swiftly updates the user interface, and the development server allows you see changes in your browser right away.
 
 Output

 The application shows a well-organized and visually appealing résumé online.  With a background color of rgba(#bdfb04), black text, and margins that change based on the size of the screen, users may see their information broken up into sections.  The page meets all the requirements and looks professional.
